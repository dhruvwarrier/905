# 905
905 is a game about a robot trying to escape a factory. As he makes his way up the factory's pristine floors, he realizes all is not as it seems. 905 is a game about the robot
condition, the Zeroth Law, and the things that make us human.

###Current progress:
- All models for the first 3 rooms are complete.
- Movement, camera and animation scripts for 905 are complete.
- Currently, work is being done on our own libraries for handling in-game objectives, actions, and user interface components.
